# ratings-crawler
Here is a code for fellow Mubi raters. This will download the Film Title, Film Year, Name of Director(s), and Rating for you. 

I love Mubi. I love their selection of films as well as their community. Thatâ€™s the reason they are my go-to site to check if a movie is any good or not before investing many hours watching it. 

I have always thought that the one key feature the site lacked was the ability to export ratings and comments we have put on the website. This and the fact that I was lazy prevented me from uploading my thousands of ratings here. In the end, we should all seek to own our data.

Thanks to my newly self-thought Python skills and a little nudge by a friend, I was able to write a basic crawler that would download my ratings from the site. Frankly, the nice back-end JSON formatting Mubi used made my job a child's play.
